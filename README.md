### Elevator pitch

The culture behind online gaming, while trending to the complex, still has niches where the simple can shine. This is especially true for games the average individual has an understanding of, like rock, paper, scissors. Users can compete against each other live in a simple game, and have their winrate for  each option (rock, paper, scissors) displayed to them as proof of their mastery of the age old children's game.

### Design
