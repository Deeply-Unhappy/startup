## ðŸš€ Specification Deliverable

> [!NOTE]
>  Fill in this sections as the submission artifact for this deliverable. You can refer to this [example](https://github.com/webprogramming260/startup-example/blob/main/README.md) for inspiration.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

The culture behind online gaming, while trending to the complex, still has niches where the simple can shine. This is especially true for games the average individual has an understanding of, like rock, paper, scissors. Users can compete against each other live in a simple game, and have their winrate for  each option (rock, paper, scissors) displayed to them as proof of their mastery of the age old children's game.

### Design
