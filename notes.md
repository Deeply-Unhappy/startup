## Github Repository assignment

This was fairly straightforward, mostly allowing me to familiarize myself with a new IDE, and the Git bash terminal.

## AWS

Starightforward, website made things easy to interact with. Will need to make note to self in financial planners to keep track of the resource.
### Domain Registry
Cannot register domain on a free account per AWS policy, will need to keep careful track of financial demand for the project from here on.

## Caddy

Needed a registered domain name to finish the Caddyfile edit the same way it was shown in course instruction. Could not find resources through personal research that would let me set up a secure connection using only an elastic IPv4.
