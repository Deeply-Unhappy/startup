# CS 260 Notes

Sections are left without suitable content until pertinent course information is encountered to justify recording

## Github Repository assignment

This was fairly straightforward, mostly allowing me to familiarize myself with a new IDE, and the Git bash terminal. 


## Helpful links

- [Course instruction](https://github.com/webprogramming260)
- [Canvas](https://byu.instructure.com)
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org)

## AWS

Starightforward, website made things easy to interact with. Will need to make note to self in financial planners to keep track of the resource.
### Domain Registry
Cannot register domain on a free account per AWS policy, will need to keep careful track of financial demand for the project from here on.

## Caddy

Needed a registered domain name to finish the Caddyfile edit the same way it was shown in course instruction. Could not find resources through personal research that would let me set up a secure connection using only an elastic IPv4.

## HTML

Mostly review from 111, have physical notes on this. No spots to submit the link of the codepen in Canvas, so assumption was made that it was not necessary to reproduce exactly the result the instructions were outlining. The following links demonstrate ability to execute the instructions but do not match expected output.

## CSS

Straightforward system, need to remember to distinguish between 1 and l when reading documentation. Will need to do research personally as to what are best practices for ordering sections of code in CSS.
